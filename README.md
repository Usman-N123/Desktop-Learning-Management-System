- Download all the files and run "FlexGui.sln". It should open the project in a new window. You can edit or run the code. If this does not work you can create a new project and include all these files the and run the code.
## Files
- **.h:** These are header files and mostly contain all the declaration of vaiables/classes.
- **.cpp:** These are source files and contain the defination of functions.
- **.txt:** All the information or data of entities is stored in these text files.
- **attendance.csv:** CSV is comma seperated files. It stores the attendance of students.
## Implementation
Front End/GUI is made using CLR in Window Forms. C++ is used in CLR. When a user clicks or enters some info the respective window or header file calls a function which is defined in cpp file. This function reads or write data drom the txt files completing the action. Text files are used to store data of users. Their names are pretty straight forward. Look in text files to see the stored information. Login credentials for admin is username: "admin", password: "admin".
